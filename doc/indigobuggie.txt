For details on the changes between versions see |indigobuggie-history|.

Indigo-Buggie (the name is a family in-joke that is not worth explaining) is
a plugin framework for editors. It is designed to take away the boring code
that will make creating plugin easier. It is designed to be cross-platform
(we will see how that goes) and extendable.

The plugins are loaded as features and each feature can be configured and
enabled/disabled individually. It should also be possible to install other
features when required.

Indigo-Buggie is built on the Beorn libraries (yup another family in-joke).
The library is released separately and each version of Indigo Buggie will
be built against a specific version of beorn_lib.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Usage                                         *indigobuggie-usage*

Indigo Buggie is a project oriented framework (<- Ahhh I hate this, can't
think of a better description).

The idea is to be able to work in a simple text editor and have some of the
features that bigger IDEs have, without the visual noise and complexity that
comes with that. So to keep things simple Indigo Buggie(IB) has a simple
visual structure.

Each instance (project) lives in a single tab. When the IB menu/UI is active
the main tab window is divided in to two main sections. The IB menu will
appear in a side window and the rest of the tab window will be left alone.

If a feature wants to create a new window it will create it in the tab, but if
you swap features all windows that have been opened by the feature will close.
With the exception of windows to regular files.

This keeps the states of the features consistent.

3.1. Opening Indigo Buggie.                             *opening-ib*

There are two ways of opening IB:

3.1.1 IB_OpenTab()

This is simplest way. It will open IB in the current directory.

For new directories if it is not a subdirectory of an existing project then
it will create a new configuration with the standard defaults as defined by
the features that you have loaded.

The features that vim will try to load a defined in the vimrc, but you can
enable and disable other ones in the configuration page, see the settings
feature.

3.1.2. IB_OpenProject()

This option is not implemented yet, please wait. Have recently changed the way
that configurations are stored, should be able to implement this sensibly to
allow for projects to open and the editor to switch the directory with the
env variables that are required.

3.1.3.  IB_OpenToFile()

This function will open the source tree (if in use) to the current file.
The tab or project needs to be opened already. Note: just starting IB will
cause this to happen.

3.2. Controlling IB                                 *basic-ib-control*

Each feature has it's own set of controls and these are defined by the feature
but there is a commonality in the framework (hopefully! as feature can call
any vim function they like) that is set my the way that the commands and menu
controls are created.

The system comes with the help command that can be turned on by calling the
|IB_ToggleHelp| function that will add a help menu that is feature sensitive
at the top of the screen.

The feature are selected by using the command sequence <leader><c-?> where the
'?' is replaced by the first char of the selectable feature name. This will
then select the feature. This can only be called within an IB menu. You may
need to call |IB_OpenTab|, |IB_OpenProject| or |IB_ReOpen| to get the menu
window. These can b e changed to your linking in Settings feature menu.

The menu window will always open to last window opened, if it had previously
been open in the current vim session, else it will open to the default feature
which will be the first selectable feature that is the enabled feature list.

To close IB call |IB_CloseWindow| and all the IB specific windows will close
and IB will go to the background. This will not stop and background activity.

3.3. Closing and Saving Data                            *ib-close-down*

IB does not save its state until the browser stops.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Features                                       *indigobuggie-features*

The features that are supported as of this version are:

    Source Tree |source_tree.txt|  The basic source tree viewer.
    SCM         |scm.txt|          The SCM interface.
    My Task     |my_task.txt|      The Task Manager.
    notes       |notes.txt|        The Notes Manager.
    Time Keeper |timekeeper.txt|   A time tracking feature. 
    Code Review |codereview.txt|   The CodeReview Manager.  
    Settings    |settings.txt|     The Settings Manager.  

The features can be enabled or disabled via the |g:IB_enabled_features|
variable. Also they can be changed in the settings. The settings cannot change
which features are loaded, just which are enabled.

They are two different types of feature, those that can be selected and those
that run in the background. For example the SCM feature provides access to the
various SCMs that are supported, and this runs in the background. With the SCM
feature it is used by others (CodeReview and SourceTree for example) to provide
a service. It can be disabled and the other features should still work.

Features that need to save data will save it in the given directory and they
will save the data within a feature directory. The data should be stored in a
file that is named to the machine and user. Why? This is to avoid merge issues
if the files are committed to an SCM.

Only one feature can be selected at one time. That means that the features menu
will be brought into a side window when in the foreground. Indigo Buggie only
allows for one side window per tab. This is simply to make the coding easier and
I find multipane UIs confusing.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Configuring indigobuggie                      *indigobuggie-config*

g:IB_enabled_features                            *g:IB_enabled_features*
    This variable holds the names of the features that are to be enabled. As
    indigo buggie is a framework for developer tools that may not work for
    you workflow this allows you to remove the features that are not used by
    you.

    But this makes the search useful. [ "SCMFeature", "SourceTreeFeature",
                                        "NotesFeature", "TimeKeeperFeature",
                                        "MyTasksFeature","CodeReviewFeature"]


g:IB_set_tab_line                                *g:IB_set_tab_line*
    This variable tell Indigo Buggie if it should update the tab line to
    show the IB tabs. [1]

g:IB_tab_name_function                           *g:IB_tab_name_function*
    Set this configuration option to the function you use to set the tabpage
    names. This will allow for custom tab page setters to be used. It will
    only be used for non-IB tabs. [IB_TabName]

g:IB_auto_create                                  *g:IB_auto_create*
    Create the project file if it does not exist. [1]

g:IB_use_project_config                             *g:IB_use_project_config*
    Use the project config.  [1]

g:IB_specific_file                                  *g:IB_specific_file*
    Use a specific configuration file. ['']

g:IB_Config_directory                               *g:IB_Config_directory*
    The directory that the config and history files are stored in.
        [".indigobuggie"]

g:IB_UseUnicode                                     *g:IB_UseUnicode*
    let the menus use unicode symbols.  [1]

g:IB_use_local_dir                                  *g:IB_use_local_dir*
    Will create a local configuration. This is not a good setting as it
    cause IB to "poo" config files and directories all over the source
    tree and filesystem. [0]

g:IB_Project_name                                   *g:IB_Project_name*
    This is the default project to open if it is set. [""]

g:IB_UseUnicode                                     *g:IB_UseUnicode*
    This will turn on/off the use of unicode (utf8 really) characters
    in the menu. [1]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Configuring features                          *indigobuggie-feature-config*

There is a settings feature that is used for configuration. The configuration
can be split into user and project. The idea is that project configuration
can be published and shared with the team and private for configuration that
is to be private for the developer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. History                                       *indigobuggie-history*

    release_1.6.1   PA  Change the documentation to match the changes that
                        were done in 1.6.0.
    release_1.6.0   PA  Many changes best see the commit log. But made some
                        changes to the configuration that was not backwards
                        compatible.
    release_1.5.2   PA  Windows fix, unused include not supported in Windows
                        Also fixed the Schrödinger's patch that keeps unfixing
                        it self. Hopefully this time. Also a configuration
                        change was not tested.
    release_1.5.1   PA  missing fix.
    release_1.5.0   PA  Fixed the issue with "stutter" looks like using
                        threads causes problems with the python global lock.
                        Can't use pure python threads as you can't start them
                        in VIM - they error. So changed to use the vim jobs
                        that start a process in the background and connects
                        to the stdin/out as channels. Also added a mechanism
                        to support feature dependant servers.
    release_1.4.0   PA  Some bug fixes, added OpenToFile, also added some
                        useful things to SourceTree. Plus tried to speed
                        up the updates and stop the stutter.
    release_1.3.3   PA  Fixes more P4 and Swarm bugs.
    release_1.3.2   PA  Fixes to Swarm after testing in a real environment.
    release_1.3.1   PA  Mostly bug fixes and fixes History and SCM sub-tree. 
    release_1.3.0   PA  Mostly bug fixes and fixed the issue with
                        configuration and data files to a sensible location
                        that stops the code pooping config and data files all
                        over the code trees.
    release_1.2.0   PA  Added Swarm support.
    release_1.1.1   PA  Fixed for Linux (and removed stutter).
    release_1.1.0   PA  Add Perforce
        Enhancement:    Add support for Perforce
                        Some other fixes as well.
    release_1.0.4   PA  Implement configuration
        Enhancement:    Lots of changes, but mostly to support the
                        configuration files also added text based dialogs
                        because why not. :) Lots of things are broken but this
                        means that the next features can go in as they will
                        require proper configuration files so that the user
                        and the project can be kept separate.
    release_1.0.3   PA  Bug Fixes:
		Bug:            Fix the SCM lookup for the items.
		Bug:            Item should lookup the SCM in it's own tree.
		Bug:            Handle SCM sub-repos correctly.
    release_1.0.2   PA  Bug Fixes:
	    Enhancement:    Tidy up SourceTreeFeature code.
	    Enhancement:    Added the diff against HEAD in source tree feature.
	    Bug: 		    Crash when SCM updates.
	    Bug: 		    Crash in `scm_feature`.
	    Bug: 		    Fix mouse click line number.
	    Bug: 		    Fixed one of the crashes in SCM
    release_1.0.1   PA  Bug Fixes:
        Enhancement:    Tidy up the syntax files.
        Enhancement:    Show submodule type names in lowercase
        Bug:            Don't crash if window has been closed.
        Bug:            Notes should reuse the file as the file name does not
                        change.
        Bug:            Always good to push all the fixes.
    release_1.0.0   PA  The initial alpha release.
