# Indigo Buggie #
## version 1.0.0 ###

This is an alpha release.

Yes it is being released as version 1, because why not. It is probably not really
fit for use yet, but I wan't to be able to install it from one place (still using
vundle) and will use it to see what features are missing and which I need to drop.

## Description ##

This is a set of development plugins.

They are all based on the BeornLib libraries.

  ** Fill this in before final commit **

## Installation ##

## Basic Configuration ##

## Starting/Stopping ##


## TODO ##

	1.	No error messages are being reported.
		Serious oversight, need to be fixed.
	2.	No logging is being kept.
		Even though the user won't see this it is worth putting in place and
		will make the rest of this eaiser.
	3.	Fix the BUGS!!!
	4.	Other SCM support (perforce next).
	5.	Real code review support (Swarm and Gerrit).
	6.	Allow conversion from the one true time to local times.
	7.	Developer documentation. How to write a new feature or an extension
		for one. I.e. code review or SCM.
	8.	Some bug fixing!!!
	9.	Notifications (for timers, code reviews, etc...)
	10. Multi-tab does not work. Probably due to cls/global variables causing problems.
		Also searching for windows/buffers are not limited correctly to the tab.
	11.	Project feature needs to be completed and the project loading.
	12.	Some of the features are not correctly handling cross machine user files but
	    this will be fixed later. Get the basic functions working first.
